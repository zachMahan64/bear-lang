#### Short-term
- [x] cast parsing (decide between c-style vs as)
- [x] fn calls
- [x] expression-statement parsing
- [x] subscript expr parsing
- [x] proper type parsing (with dedicated ast_type_t nodes)
- [x] fix right assoc bug
- [x] add alignof
- [x] parameter parsing when parsing functions
- [x] array type parsing
- [x] generic type parsing
- [x] full casting, sizeof, alignof operator support
- [x] pub/hid parsing for statements
- [x] `...` and range/slice related syntax
- [x] add slices as \[&]i32
- [x] solve vexing parse around how to resolve `a[b];` expr-stmts caused by my array syntax, peek in loop to see if we find a `token_is_posttype_indicator` or `;` first? See `tests/9.br`
- [x] module parsing 
    - finish implementing `parse_stmt_decl` and  `parse_slice_of_decls` in top level file and module statement slices. Decide how to implement `ast_stmt_module_block_t`, perhaps just don't use a block and just expect curly braces on either side of stmt slice, but get the slice thru `parse_slice_of_decls`
- [ ] test modules and vis modifiers
    - [ ] make id be a token slice, not id as expr
    - [ ] prevent duplicate pub/hid by matching in a loop
- [ ] other statement parsing
- [ ] structs
- [ ] marks
- [ ] closures?
- [ ] decide between and impl switch and/or match 

#### Medium-term
- [ ] Get a solid subset of the parser working on building an AST
- [ ] Write unit tests for the parser and work on a basic AST walker for debug logging (will also be helpful for semantic analysis and codegen)
- [ ] Revamp CLI to be much more robust using the strimap_t and vector_t containers
