#### Short-term to-do list
- [ ] Finish good error message print-outs and finalize error list api
- [ ] Get a solid subset of the parser working on building an AST
- [ ] Write unit tests for the parser and work on a basic AST walker for debug logging (will also be helpful for semantic analysis and codegen)
- [ ] Revamp CLI to be much more robust using the strimap_t and vector_t containers
