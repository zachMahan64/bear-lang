#### Short-term
- [x] cast parsing (decide between c-style vs as)
- [x] fn calls
- [x] expression-statement parsing
- [x] subscript expr parsing
- [x] proper type parsing (with dedicated ast_type_t nodes)
- [x] fix right assoc bug
- [x] add alignof
- [x] parameter parsing when parsing functions
- [x] array type parsing
- [x] generic type parsing
- [x] full casting, sizeof, alignof operator support
- [x] pub/hid parsing for statements
- [x] `...` and range/slice related syntax
- [x] add slices as \[&]i32
- [x] solve vexing parse around how to resolve `a[b];` expr-stmts caused by my array syntax, peek in loop to see if we find a `token_is_posttype_indicator` or `;` first? See `tests/9.br`
- [x] module parsing 
    - finish implementing `parse_stmt_decl` and  `parse_slice_of_decls` in top level file and module statement slices. Decide how to implement `ast_stmt_module_block_t`, perhaps just don't use a block and just expect curly braces on either side of stmt slice, but get the slice thru `parse_slice_of_decls`
- [x] test modules and vis modifiers
- [x] make id be a token, not id as expr in module parsing
- [x] prevent duplicate pub/hid by matching in a loop
- [x] if, else/else if
- [x] while & break statements
- [x] handle infinitely loop in tests/01.br
- [x] import statements
- [x] using statements
- [x] c-style for 
- [x] for x in expr statements
- [x] compt qualifier on fn decls and variables
- [x] full generic syntax (use the `<T has(Size), var N>` syntax)
- [x] test generic fn decls and calls more, improve error messaging and recovery
- [x] struct decls
- [x] generalize `parse_slice_of_stmts` with a call parameter for better field parsing
- [ ] `contract` decls, add kw, add function signature parsing, use updated func ^ to parse body of contract decls are just fn_sig decls, requires clauses
- [ ] struct init-expressions
- [ ] unions (add union tkn)
- [ ] enums
- [ ] variants (add variant tkn)
- [ ] add is token and impl the `if foo is Some(x) {...}` construct
- [ ] switch exprs?
- [ ] switch statements
- [ ] closures
- [ ] rewrite ansi code usages to use toggleable strings
- [ ] write a full parser test suite

#### Medium-term
- [ ] finish parser
- [ ] revamp CLI to be much more robust using the strimap_t and vector_t containers and set up a proper flag system
