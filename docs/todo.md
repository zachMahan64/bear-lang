#### todos
- [x] add typed scope table accessor/mutator functions
- [x] add scope ctor & dtor
- [x] write the new file tracking system into tables.h 
- [x] fix anonymous struct decls, make includes `__cplusplus` safe
- [x] C++ify HIR
- [x] Make Scope fully c++ified (finish translating Cisms)
- [x] Change scope to used std::vector since it's lazy
- [x] add an ArenaStringHashMap implementation for sybmbols (or consider an LLVM datastructure), see comment in hir/builder.cpp
- [x] flesh out query system a bit more, make a better ctor
- [x] improve CLI to accept import paths
- [x] finish hir structural impls
    - [x] defs
    - [x] types
    - [x] exec
        - [x] mapping from token operator token_type_e's -> hir-specific operator types 
    - [x] generics args/params
- [x] impl limited external query system for hir::Context
- [x] revamp to compiler_error_list_t to include diagnostics messages ("note")
- [ ] finish impl top-level traversal for filling named scopes
    - [ ] handle Foo..bar() function declaration (see TD comment in ast_visitor.cpp)
    - [x] make sure to set the parent field in defs (current the `OptId<DefId> parent` field is always none), this will later be important for canonicalizing definitons (especially types)
- [ ] add better diagnostics (interned in HIR), which is file-wise, but track a `next_diag` chain and then store a `bool reported` to ensure no duplicate reporting
    - [ ] add semantic diagnostics of various types, store metadata, and then write a stdout reporter (this will be seperate from tokenwise diagnostics). This will probably require dedicated DiagnosticId -> Diagnostic: Error | Warning | Note 
- [ ] debug logger to display context and scope contents 

- [ ] hir phase 2: begin identifier resolution, typechecking, and constant folidng/compt analysis
    - [ ] add CanonicalTypeHashTable for single-instantiation generics 
#### Medium term
- [ ] HIR
- [ ] MIR? (compile-time ctrl flow and better optimizations) 
- [ ] LLVM IR
