main quest
----------

#### hir phase 2.a:
- all while in the process of *resolivng* top-level declarations:
    
- [ ] clean up any remaining dangling reference issues (made evident in test cases with very large compt param counts)
    - should be fixed for now, but this could come up in the future
    - factor out def visitor logic in seperate functions to help here

- [ ] some more `compt` improvements and general resolution/lowering logic:
    - [x] union def resol
    - [ ] union inits (wip)
    - [ ] union member accesses (checked)
    - [ ] variant def resol
    - [ ] compt unions/variants
        - unions should be pretty simple
        - variants are essentially just struct {union{types...}, ordinal}
    - [ ] compt match: impl as chained comparisions ensuring each branch matches the type inside match(x)
        - [ ] handle the inline case syntax `cond | cond | cond`
        - [ ] make sure it's branches are exhaustive
            - [ ] for now, just make sure there's an `else` clause or that both `true`/`false` are covered
            - [ ] if feasible, add range checking 
    - [ ] compt closures (pure-expr only)
        - [ ] allow capturing compt variables 

- [x] contract resolution
    - [ ] issue diagnostics that say exactly what's wrong
        - [x] param count mismatch
        - [x] return-type mismatch
        - [x] `mt` and `Self` related stuff (particularly with mut disagreements)
        - [ ] per-param disagreements

- [ ] implement generic args canonicalization to allow mapping of canonical lists of generic args to concrete instatiations for generic structs, variants, and functions
    - factor out `ComptExprSolver`'s equality logic (`ExecConst`, `ExecExprListInit`, and `ExecExprStructInit`) to use for comparing comparing compt execs inside the table
    - write ExecId hasher akin to the TypeTransformer/TypeHasher construct
    - all generic params become either deftypes to type args or simply compt variables for expression value args 
    - see and finish impl'ing the canonical generic args slice table outline, basically each canonical set of generic args for a given def needs to either:
        1. map to an already instatiated specialized, concrete instance of the def, or:
        2. instatiate a new defintion by lowering the `ast_stmt_t` after inserting the specific defintions for values into a new scope for the concrete type 

- [ ] **use canonical generic args canonicalization to memoize compt function args -> values**

- [ ] `ast_type_t*` lowering to `hir::Type`s 
    - [x] all non-generic types 
    - [ ] generic types (just find/instatiate mentioned generic def and then use that concrete def within the type)
    - [ ] handle all-encompassing type deduction with `var` in decls: a `TypeInferer` allowing `var` to be decorated with `*`, `&`, etc, could be allowable with the `TypeTransformer` construct
    - [ ] A `TypeIsInferable` functor could be useful (this would allow decorated `var`s), just walk and match `TypeVar` with anything 

- [ ] tighten up abi related stuff with hir::LayoutRules or something similar
    - [ ] properly impl `sizeof` and `alignof`, make them generalized as a primitive query in `hir::Context` and then plug into `hir::ComptExprSolver` and later the runtime expr solver

- [ ] preliminary full `ast_stmt_t*` (top-level decls) lowering to `hir::Def` (requires both types and exprs)
    - this should be entirely done after full type lowering

- [ ] some basic [lsp-compat](/docs/lsp-compat.md), mostly thru building span -> scope search trees (only build these when a flag is enabled, tho; this will need to be added)

- [ ] finalize internal resolution logic on `hir::TopLevelVisitor` using all the lowering logic for every possible `ast_stmt_t`

#### hir phase 2.b (function body resolution):
- [ ] make sure assignment type checking is properly rigid especially around mutable references.
    - the way mutable references are strucutured is that HIR stores all references types as mut/immut on the reference layer and then the next inner value type is always stored as immut since the mutability only binds to the reference logically. So, be sure to take this into account. 
- [ ] make a system to etch ExecId into a structured linear form within blocks to be naturally connected in a CFG 
    - [ ] this should be directly conducive to 3AC for all `hir::Exec`s
- [ ] move checker
- [ ] a borrow checker should be trivial, however:
    - [ ] allow mutiple immutable and mutable borrows
    - [ ] no lifetimes
    - [ ] strictly ban returning a reference to a local variable
- [ ] remember: run-time values that are immutable references and have compile-time initializers can just reference static variables that store that compile-time value
- [ ] LLVM lowering prep:
    - [ ] tighten up mention/mutation tracking for better `unused variable: foo` diagnostics (and top level decls when not a lib build)
    - [ ] either queue struct and function declarations (cheaper linear lowering to LLVM) or use a scope iterator 
    - [ ] just find main thru top-level scope; only require it in non-lib builds 
    - [ ] add a flag for exec/lib build to track diagnostics slightly different (described above)
    - [ ] finalize `extern {}` and `extern C {}` semantics for cross-TU and FFI compilation respectively
        - [ ] hand out errors for C-incompatible functions when under a C abi extern, like no references, generics, etc.

#### optimizations
- [ ] add a `-i` flag to specify specific files for parallel builds
- [ ] `hir::Context` ctor that takes a stale context and a list of updated files, and then based on the stale context's files (necessary for above flag and also AST reuse for the future LSP):
```
    for every file in stale context:
        if red: # stale and already marked as such 
            continue 
        if not red && stale: 
            color it and its dependents red
            continue 
        # since it's not stale:
        move file and it's data (buffer, token, ast) from stale context into new context

    delete the stale context and replace it with the new context 
    # note make sure dtor of files inside context properly handle being moved (no double frees, etc.)
```
#### long term (compiler)
- [ ] MIR? (compile-time ctrl flow and better optimizations)
- [ ] LLVM IR (most likely lower directly from HIR)

#### tools 
- [ ] cave package-manager
    - run, init, build, check, and other nice-to-haves

- [ ] language server 
    - using the LSP (for VSCode/IDE/text-editor portability)
    - implemented in C++ (or Rust) using libbearc

- [ ] bear-tree-sitter
    - parser implemented with tree-sitter for complex syntax highlighing 

- [ ] VSCode
    - [x] At minimum, a regex-based syntax highlighter
    - [ ] basic cave/bearc integration (run button)

- [ ] Improve debugger compatibility 

side quests
-----------

#### chores

lexer & parser 
--------------
- [ ] improve numerical literal handling 
    - [ ] probably just replace strtoll and friends with hand-rolled impls 
    - [ ] add binary integer literals `0b1010101` (keeping dec, hex, and float that we currently already have)
    - [ ] set a tkn to TOK_OVERSIZED_INT_ERR if there's no decimal and it's greater than u64 max or less than i64 min
- [ ] verify correctness of escape sequences in char and string literals

hir & later 
----------- 
- [ ] allow arbitrarily ordered struct members inits, will require mini symbol hashmaps
- [ ] add an Exec Stringifier (tedious)
- [ ] add a Def Stringifier (tedious)  
- [ ] arbitrary source code reconstruction from hir::Context

#### diagnostics
- [ ] elipse out diagnostics after like 8 lines
- [ ] add trimming of cwd from file paths in diagnostics reporting?
- [ ] fully allow cyclical imports, add a flag to enable warnings instead of always warning for it
- [ ] using a scope iterator, use Levenshtein distance to make a `help: did you mean:` `...`

#### debugging 
- [x] make a scope iterator
- [ ] debug logger to display context and scope contents

#### lsp-friendly features
- [lsp compatibility plan here](docs/lsp-compat.md)
