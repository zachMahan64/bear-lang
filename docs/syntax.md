### Bear syntax
- **Work In Progress:** this document will be the main syntax reference before moving to a more rigorous system of seperate documents for each language feature.

#### Basic built-in types:
- Signed integers: `i8, i16, i32, i64`
- Unsigned integers: `u8, u16, u32, u64, usize`
- Floating-points: `f32, f64`
- primitive strings: `str`
- booleans: `bool`

#### Declarations
- Declaring a variable:
```
i32 x = 42; // with a specified type of i32
```
